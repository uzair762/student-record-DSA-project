📝 Project Description

The Student Record Management System is designed as a DSA course project where student data such as roll number, name, department, and marks are stored using appropriate data structures.

The system allows users to add new student records, search existing records, update information, and delete records. By using data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, or trees, the project demonstrates how DSA concepts improve performance and data organization.
